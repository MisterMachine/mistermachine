              <p>We worked closely with the team at Ngaged, a Brooklyn-based software and technology start-up focused on transforming the learning process for the University and broader education market, to produce a platform for student and teacher’s to interact outside the classroom. </p>
  
  <p>The result was a series of mobile prototypes which allowed the developers and primary stakeholders to test key user scenarios. We had an exceptional time creating targeted versions of their primary desktop pffering which then allowed students to focus on simple actions like bookmarking and audio playback.</p>
